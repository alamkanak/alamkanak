**Hi, Iâ€™m Raquib-ul.** 

Professionally, I work as a Senior Software Engineer with a flavor of Deep Learning integration. My Android experiences span over 10 years.

Academically, my research focusses on medical image and signal processing towards the development of machine learning and statistical models.
