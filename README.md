**Hi, I’m Raquib-ul.** I’m the founder and lead engineer of [Series Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alamkanak.seriesaddict), but I also work as a deep learning research student for medical image analysis at University of Sydney, Australia. I've also done Android stuff like [Android-Week-View](https://github.com/alamkanak/Android-Week-View). You can see some of my older work in my old [portfolio](http://alamkanak.github.io).
