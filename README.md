**Hi, Iâ€™m Raquib-ul.** 

Professionally, I work as a Senior Android Engineer with a flavor of Deep Learning integration. My Android experiences span over eight years.

Academically, my research focusses on medical image and signal processing towards the development of machine learning and statistical models.

You can see some of my work in my [portfolio](https://alamkanak.github.io).
